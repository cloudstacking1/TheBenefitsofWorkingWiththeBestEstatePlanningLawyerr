                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: Estate planning involves arranging for the management and distribution of your assets after your death. It ensures that your wishes are honored, minimizes taxes, and can prevent potential disputes among family members. Key documents include a will, trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives. Proper estate planning is essential for protecting your legacy and providing for your loved ones.</div>

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2:What happens if I die without an estate plan<span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A: Dying without an estate plan means your assets will be distributed according to New York's intestacy laws, which may not align with your wishes. This can lead to delays, increased costs, and potential conflicts among heirs. Having a comprehensive estate plan in place ensures that your intentions are honored and can simplify the probate process.

Engaging an experienced probate attorney can help expedite the process and ensure that all legal requirements are met.
